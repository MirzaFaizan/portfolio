    I am a self-taught developer with a Computer Science degree also a wannabe entrepreneur with a small chunk failed and partially successful startups (well I am not giving up soon) well more like a problem solver to make life of people a little easy with my code. I believe in developing compassionate web apps around user needs. I craft full-stack web and mobile applications. I am a MERN stack junkie primarily focused on JS/TS & Go with a dash of DevOps. I can talk about code and how it affects people around us for hours. Sometimes I give workshops.
